### 1. *AI-Powered Crop Selector*  
*Pitch*:  
"Build an AI-driven tool that recommends the best crops to grow in a specific region by analyzing local climate, soil type, and water availability. This tool empowers farmers to make data-driven decisions, ensuring sustainable and profitable farming."

*Why Itâ€™s Great for a Hackathon*:
- Combines AI (e.g., ML models for recommendation) with a social impact angle.  
- Easy to implement using public datasets (e.g., FAO, NOAA).  

*Tech Approach*:
- Train a basic ML model (e.g., Decision Tree or Random Forest) on crop-climate data.  
- Use a simple web or mobile interface for demo.
