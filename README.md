## Installation üîß

To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/saibrvitm/AI-Powered-Agriculture-App.git
   cd AI-Powered-Agriculture-App
   ```

2. **Backend Setup:**
   - Go to the `dev` folder inside the `crop-selector` directory.
   - Run the `suggest_crop.py` script.
   - Ensure that the output .pkl file is stored in the `crop-selector` directory

3. **Install FastAPI and run the backend server:**
   - Inside the `dev` folder, install the necessary dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install fastapi
     ```
   - Start the FastAPI server by running the following:
     ```bash
     fastapi dev server.py
     ```
   - This will start the backend server that handles crop suggestions.

4. **Frontend Setup:**
   - Navigate to the `frontend/frontend` folder:
     ```bash
     cd frontend/frontend
     ```
   - Install the required frontend dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - Start the frontend server:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
   - The application will be available on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage üìà

Once the backend and frontend servers are running:

1. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the user interface.
2. Input your crop-related data (such as soil information, weather conditions, etc.) to receive personalized crop recommendations.
3. You can also analyze plant health, get fertilizer suggestions, and access weather insights tailored to agricultural needs.
